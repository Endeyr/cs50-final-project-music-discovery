What will your software do? 
    My software will use the Spotify API to display a users requested artist's info and related artist to the dashboard. Users will be able to login and see their search history

What features will it have? How will it be executed?
    Login using flask and postgres
    Api request using Spotify API 
    Hosted on github pages
    Styling using my own style guide

What new skills will you need to acquire? 
    I will need to learn how to use Postgres as well as work with APIs

What topics will you need to research?
    I need to research how to call APIs and how to connect to a postgres database.

In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so itâ€™s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. 

What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? 
    A good outcome would be if the website works as intended with little to no bugs.

A better outcome? 
    A better outcome would be that I can add features and stylize the website in a cool way. 

The best outcome?
    The best outcome would be if I can make an app that I want to use to discover new music and keep up to date with my favorite artist.
